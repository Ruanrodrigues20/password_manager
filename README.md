# Password Manager

This is a simple script for password management, where you can add, search, remove, and update passwords for different services securely. The system uses AES-256 encryption to protect the passwords, and a master password is required to access and perform operations.

## Installation and Configuration

To make it easier to use, it is recommended to create an alias for the script, so you can call it from anywhere in the terminal.

### 1. Create an alias

Add the following alias to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file, depending on the shell you use. This allows you to run the script with a simple command from any directory:

```bash
alias password_manager='/path/to/password_manager.sh'
```

Replace `/path/to/password_manager.sh` with the full path to the script. For example, if the script is in your `~/scripts` folder, the line will look like this:

```bash
alias password_manager='~/scripts/password_manager.sh'
```

After adding the alias, run the following command to reload the shell configuration file:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, you can call the script from anywhere with the command:

```bash
password_manager
```

### 2. Making the script executable

Make sure the script has execution permissions. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/password_manager.sh
```

Now, the script is ready to be executed!
