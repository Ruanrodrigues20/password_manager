# Password Manager

This is a simple script for password management, where you can add, search, remove, and update passwords for different services securely. The system uses AES-256 encryption to protect the passwords, and a master password is required to access and perform operations.

## Installation and Configuration

To make it easier to use, it is recommended to use the provided installation script. This will install the password manager and configure it for easy access.

### 1. Install the Password Manager

Run the installation script to install and configure the password manager:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This script will:

- Copy the `password_manager.sh` script to the appropriate directory (`~/.password_manager`).
- Set up the alias to allow running the script from anywhere in the terminal.
- Prompt you to create a master password.

### 2. Uninstall the Password Manager

To uninstall the password manager and remove all configurations, run the uninstall script:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

This will:

- Remove the `password_manager.sh` script from `~/.password_manager`.
- Remove the alias from your shell configuration.
  
### 3. Create an alias (if not using the install script)

If you prefer to manually set up the alias, add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file, depending on your shell:

```bash
alias password_manager='/path/to/password_manager.sh'
```

Replace `/path/to/password_manager.sh` with the full path to the script. For example, if the script is in your `~/.password_manager` folder, the line will look like this:

```bash
alias password_manager='~/.password_manager/password_manager.sh'
```

After adding the alias, run the following command to reload the shell configuration file:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, you can call the script from anywhere with the command:

```bash
password_manager
```

### 4. Making the script executable

Make sure the script has execution permissions. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/password_manager.sh
```

Now, the script is ready to be executed!
